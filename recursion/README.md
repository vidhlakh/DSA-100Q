# RECURSION 

## What is recursion 
Function calling itself is recursion function

## When to use recursion 
- When a bigger problem is divided into simpler to smaller problem, we have to go for recursion 
- Recursive tree based on the order of the call 
Say f(1) -> f(2) -> f(3) -> f(4) -> f(5)
Return of call is in this order f(5)->f(4)->f(3)->f(2)->f(1)
- Function call in memory is made using recursive stack (LIFO)

## Base Condition 
- stopping condition inorder to come out of the function 

## Recurrence relation 
- mathematical representation of the function 

## Recursive vs Iterative 
- Recursive involves more space as it takes stack space 
- Short & Easy to understand 

### Jorgons
- Subarray: contiguous elements 
- Subsequences: non contiguous elements(doesnt have to be continuous, may be or may not be continuous)
